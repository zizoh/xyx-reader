# XYZ Reader

In this app the user experience of a news reading app is transformed using Material Design principles. 
This includes consistent and meaningful use of Material Design UI components, fonts, color, motion and surfaces.

Taking user feedback from the UI Review, changes were implemented to improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.
